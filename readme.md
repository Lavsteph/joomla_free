# Some scripts to simplify your tasks Joomla

In this repository, you'll find a few scripts that I've written for my own use.  Perhaps one of these scripts will be usefull for you too.

## show_table

show_table.php allows you to extract informations from your Joomla database : run a SQL query and export it as a table.  Nice HTML output with Bootstrap and jQuery or a RAW output to only output a <table> tag so the generated table can be easily reuse in, for instance, a spreadsheet program.
